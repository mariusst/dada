This is the Dada Scissors. A simple PHP script to extract document fragments for use in your html collage.

HOW TO USE IT?

There are 2 parameters that need to be fed to the script: the url of the source page
and the absolute xpath with the location of the desired fragment.

1. Put this script in a location where your web server has access and can execute it.
2. In your web browser addres bar insert the script url and add the querie string;
to get the absolute xpath, execute something like:
    http://example.com/dada.php?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software&xpath=//p
where "//p" is a simple query that will output all p elements in the document.
After executing this you will get the content of all p elements and their absolute xpath.
3. After identifying the absolute xpath of your desired document fragment redo the query string with something like:
    http://example.com/dada.php?url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software&xpath=/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[4]/p[6]
